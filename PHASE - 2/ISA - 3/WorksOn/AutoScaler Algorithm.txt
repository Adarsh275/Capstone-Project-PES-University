## Algorithm 1 Autoscaling Algorithm for resource allocation. ##

Input: Total_Pods, Total_CPU_Usage_Value, Total_CPU_target_value;
Output: Total_Podsn = Total number of pod to be scheduled.

Total_Pods = sum(pod0,pod1,.....Podn)); // Calculates the total number of pods running in cluster
Size_of_cluster = Total_Pods.length;
Total_CPU_target_value = fetch_target_CPU(); // API call for fetching the target CPU
Total_CPU_Usage_Value = fetch current usage(); // API call for fetching the current CPU usage.

if Size_of_cluster > 0 && Total_CPU_Usage_Value > (Size_of_cluster*Total_CPU_target_value) then
   for i in Total_Pods do
      Total_Podsn = Total_CPU_Usage_Value / Total CPU target value // Calculate the total number of pods.
   end
end
